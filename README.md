# Codsoft Internship - Java Projects

Welcome to the Codsoft Internship repository! This repository contains the projects completed as part of the internship, showcasing various Java applications developed during the internship period.


## Introduction
This repository is a compilation of projects developed during the Codsoft internship, focusing on Java programming. Each project is designed to demonstrate different skills and aspects of Java development.

## Tasks

### Task 1: NUMBER GAME
Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.

### Task 2: STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.
Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the
average percentage.
Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user

### Task 3: ATM INTERFACE
Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
checking the balance.
Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
checkBalance().
Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
balance.
Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
of their transactions.

### Task 4: CURRENCY CONVERTER:
Currency Selection: Allow the user to choose the base currency and the target
currency.
Currency Rates: Fetch real-time exchange rates from a reliable API.
Amount Input: Take input from the user for the amount they want to convert.
Currency Conversion: Convert the input amount from the base currency to the
target currency using the fetched exchange rate.
Display Result: Show the converted amount and the target currency symbol
to the user.

### Task 5: STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll
number, grade, and any other relevant details.
Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. Include
methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.
